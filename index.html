        <h2>About this website</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Changning Niu. Welcome to my personal website.</p>
        <p>This website provides the most accurate and latest information about me. Although I have several social network accounts, they either allow only limited access by the general public or are not updated promptly. But here at this website, I guarantee that all information will be correct and up-to-date.</p>

        <h2>My Curriculum Vitae</h2>
        <p>The PDF version of my Curriculum Vitae can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/changning/changning.github.io/blob/master/CV/Niu_CV.pdf">here</a>.</p>
        <p>A peek at my CV:</p>
        <p><i>Professional Expeirence</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2015â€“2016, <b>Postdoctoral Researcher</b>, Materials Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>Education</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2015, <b>Ph.D.</b>, Materials Science and Engineering, North Carolina State University</li>
            <li>2011, <b>B.Sc.</b>, Materials Physics, University of Science and Technology Beijing</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>Peer-Reviewed Publications</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>See my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QZEhJPAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar Profile</a></li>
            <li>Summary (as of 5/3/2016): 6 journal articles, 1 book chapter, 100 citations</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Research Highlights</h2>
        <p>My research has focused on studies of solid-state materials using computational methods.</p>
        <p>During my PhD program, I studied the so-called high entropy alloys. These alloys are mostly chemically disordered on a simple crystal lattice (body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic, etc.), which makes it particularly difficult to simulate using first principles methods.</p>
        <p>Reports on work I contributed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2015/04/irving-hea-spin-2015/">Electron Spin Brings Some Order to High Entropy Alloys</a> (NC State News)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        I have written the following codes and decide to make them open for public.
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/changning/sqs2poscar">sqs2poscar</a>: a C++ code to convert <code>bestsqs.out</code> generated by <code>mcsqs</code> to a standard <code>POSCAR</code> file for VASP. (Hosted on Github)</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/changning/poscar2pdf">poscar2pdf</a>: a C++ code to calculate the pair distribution function (PDF) from a <code>POSCAR</code> file. (Hosted on Github)</li>
        </ul>
