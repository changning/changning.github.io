# Research

My peer-reviewed publication list is available at [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QZEhJPAAAAAJ&hl=en).

At QuesTek, I lead and contribute to various government/commercial/internal projects. Most of these projects are research-oriented, focusing on different topics in the field of integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) and materials genome. To name a few:
* CALPHAD in the Cloud
* Materials Genome and Integrated Computational Materials Engineering Toolkit
* Mechanistically Enhanced Machine Learning for Materials Design and Process Optimization

During my PhD and postdoc, my research has focused on atomic-level computational studies of materials:
* Energetics and phase stability of chemically (partially) disordered alloys and oxides
* Phonon vibrations in crystalline materials
* Density functional theory (DFT) simulation of alloys with magnetism
* Defect formation in solid solution alloys
* Transition state of point defects in crystalline materials using nudged elastic band method
* Marchov Chain Monte Carlo simulation combined with DFT
